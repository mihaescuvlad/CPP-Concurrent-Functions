# :books: CPP-Concurrent-Functions :books:

This project contains a collection of C++ functions that demonstrate concurrent and parallel programming techniques. The purpose of this project was to learn about concurrent programming and explore various techniques for implementing concurrency in C++.

## Functions

The following functions are included in this project:

`parallel_accumulate`

This function performs a parallel addition of the elements in a provided container using multiple threads. Each thread is responsible for adding a specific subset of elements from the provided container.

`threadsafe_stack`

This container works similarly to a STL `std::stack` while being thread safe.

## Usage

To use these functions, simply include the appropriate header file in your C++ project and call the desired function.
